    Assignment 1: Implement a navigation bar using an unordered list with links to different sections
    of your HTML page. Use CSS to style the list as a horizontal menu and highlight the current page
    or section.
 
Assignment 2: Create a simple HTML page that includes the use of headings, paragraphs,
 and at least two semantic tags like <article> or <section>. Add a table with data of 
 your choice and a form with fields for a user's name, email, and a submit button.
 
Assignment 3: Apply the CSS box model to ensure that your page content has appropriate 
margins and padding. Create a layout using div tags and style them to arrange content 
in a multi-column format using floats or flexbox.
 
Assignment 4: Enhance the page by adding CSS3 animations to the menu and form elements.
 Also, use media queries to make the page responsive, ensuring it looks good on both 
 desktop and mobile screen sizes.
 
Assignment 5: Take the static HTML page from Day 1 and integrate Bootstrap. Refactor
 the navigation bar, table, and form to use Bootstrap components. Ensure the page is 
 responsive using Bootstrap's grid system."
